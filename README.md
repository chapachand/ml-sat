Currently developing code to combine satellites data via machine learning

The data product files at in netCDF form, however the data are stored in them differentially.
At the time of writing, the methane data in TROPESS file has not been able to be manipulated into the same form as the sentinel-5p data
Further work will be done to achieve this by doing more research into how the TROPESS data has been stored


Once the data has been extracted in the same manner, machine learning and spatial statistical modelling will be done to combine the two data products.
